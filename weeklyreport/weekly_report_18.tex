\section{Experiments and Results}
\subsection{Finger Knuckle V3 Database with Deformation}

The Finger Knuckle V3 Database have 1-104 subjects that have two session samples, and the rest subjects of first session 105-221 just offer one session samples. So as the first experiment, I firstly fine-tuned my model on the one-session 1-104 dataset, and test on the another session 1-104 subjects. So it will have $104*6=624$ genuine matching scores, and have $104*103*6=64272$ imposter matching scores. From the below figure, if the false accept rate is below $10^{-2}$, the RFN-128-WRS is better than the RFN-128-WS.

As for the two-session protocol on the database. I should fine-tune my model on the 105-221 subjects, and use two-session protocol to evaluate my model performance on the 1-104 subjects dataset. In totally, it will generate $104*6=624$ genuine scores, and $104*103*6$ imposter scores.

The two-session protocol will use the session1 as the probe and use the session2 as the enrollment. As for the genuine matching scores, each sample of a subject will choose the minimal matching score when compare to the rest samples. In this kind of situation, it will have $104x6$ genuine matching scores. Meanwhile, as for the imposter matching scores, it will also choose the minimal value result in $104*103*6$ imposter matching scores on the confusion matrix.

\section{Next Week Plans}
1. Follow the last week's plans to detect key points project; \\2. Do some ablation experiments as for the deformable finger knuckle database with change shift parameter and rotation parameter.
