\textcolor{red}{For the ROC curve, I add EfficientNetV2-S model performance.} Update CMC Curve and ROC Curve with EfficientNet, DeConvRFNet and RFNet. As for the experiment, the dataset totally contains 712 subjects, and I use the segmented Index finger knuckle as my dataset. And I fine-tuned my model on the first sample of each subject, and then use the rest four sample as the testing dataset. At the testing process, it has $712*4=2848$ genuine matching scores, and has $712*711*4=2024928$ imposter matching scores. The performance of RFN-128-WRS and RFN-128-WS is similar, but the RFN-128-WS is slightly better than RFN-128-WRS depend on the EER value. And we can get an information that the RFNet is better than the rest network in the ROC figure, including the FKNet.
